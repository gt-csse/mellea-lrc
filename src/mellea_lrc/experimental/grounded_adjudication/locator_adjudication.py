"""Ask a model to read a suspected site and report the locators actually there.

The model never returns offsets. It quotes each locator verbatim, and the quote
is then grounded deterministically back into the document, so a hallucinated or
paraphrased answer fails to resolve rather than producing a plausible-looking
span. This is the same contract the pinpoint evidence quote uses.

Two details matter for span fidelity:

*   The window shown to the model has its repeated inline whitespace collapsed.
    Layout-damaged text is full of column padding, and a model reading
    ``937   S.W.2d   796`` is markedly less likely to quote it back in a shape
    that can be found again. Collapsing first also makes the quote easier to
    ground.
*   Because the model sees collapsed text, a resolved span is in collapsed
    coordinates. It is mapped back onto the original window, and then to
    document coordinates, so callers receive offsets into the real document.

The model is asked about the whole window rather than the flagged position. A
locator whose volume is missing or displaced never carries the flag itself --
what surfaces is a court abbreviation in its own parenthetical -- so restricting
the question to the flagged span would make those unreachable.

Below is a window of text taken from a legal filing whose PDF extraction is
often damaged: spaces are lost or doubled, line breaks fall mid-citation, and
table columns interleave.

{{reporter_context}}

List every citation LOCATOR that appears in this window. A locator is the
volume, reporter and page that together identify one case.

For each one, report four things:
- text    the locator quoted EXACTLY as written in the window, character for
          character, including any damage
- volume  the volume, as digits
- reporter the reporter
- page    the page, a single number

Damage belongs in "text" and must be repaired in the other three fields:

- "731P.2d902" -> text="731P.2d902", volume="731", reporter="P.2d", page="902"
- "88 Cal. Rptr.\n\n3d 411" -> text="88 Cal. Rptr.\n\n3d 411", volume="88",
  reporter="Cal. Rptr. 3d", page="411"
- "509 N.W.2d\n\n144" -> text="509 N.W.2d\n\n144", volume="509",
  reporter="N.W.2d", page="144"

A line break does not end a locator. If the volume, reporter or page continues
after a newline, quote straight through it, newlines and all.

Rules:
- Quote "text" exactly. Do not tidy its spacing or punctuation. The quote is
  checked against the window and a repaired quote will not be found.
- "text" must contain the volume, the reporter and the page and nothing else -
  no case name, no year, no pin cite. Start at the volume.
- Report a locator ONLY when all three parts are there to be quoted, in one
  run of text, however damaged. Never invent a missing part.
- If a part is genuinely not present - a volume that appears in a different
  table row or column, a page that was never written - report nothing for that
  locator. A part separated only by spaces or line breaks IS present; a part
  somewhere else in the document is not.
- A page is a SINGLE number. If a reporter is followed by a run of counting
  numbers ("1 2 3 4 5 ..."), those are PDF margin line numbers and not a page:
  the page is missing, so report nothing.
- Never report a bare number on its own. A pin cite such as "1187" is part of a
  citation, not a locator.
- Report nothing for statutes, rules, docket numbers, dates, court names, or
  street addresses.
- If the window contains no complete case locator, return an empty list.
